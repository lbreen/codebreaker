<h1>Codebreaker</h1>

<strong>Aim:</strong> To decypher text-based messages

<strong>Description:</strong> By passing a scrambled word or sentence as a parameter the code will rearrange the letter order to reveal the original message. My initial tactic will be a brute force approach in order to decypher the code, but research during the project will reveal more efficient methods. The endgoal of this project is to recreate the Colossus computer, used by the codebreakers at Bletchley Park during the Second World War.

<strong>Goals:</strong>

<s>1) Unscramble a word and display the most likely answers.</s>
2) Unscramble a sentence and display the most likely answers.
